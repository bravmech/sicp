count-change space order of growth:
- O(n) because max depth is n

count-change time order of growth:
1. cc(n, 1) = O(n)
2. cc(n, 2) = cc(n, 1) + cc(n-5, 2) [1]
3. each 2. step is O(n) on average and there are roughly n/5 such steps
4. so we have O(n^2)
5. by analogy we get O(n^k) (k currencies)

[1] here it makes sense to order coins from largest to smallest
